The Dynamics and Neural Systems Group is an interdisciplinary research team in the [School of Physics](http://sydney.edu.au/science/physics/) at [The University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au/) led by [Ben Fulcher](http://www.benfulcher.com).

We do quantitative research focused on understanding the properties of complex dynamical systems by applying (and developing new) physical and statistical methods.
We apply these tools to applications in neuroscience to gain a quantitative, physically based understanding of how the brain works.

We are located at The University of Sydney, which has a beautiful campus full of intelligent people and a vibrant interdisciplinary community that includes researchers in physics, maths, statistics, computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and biomedical science, all investigating the brain.

We are a part of [Complex Systems Physics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/physics/complex-systems.html).
Being an interdisciplinary group, we collaborate closely with diverse researchers, including information theory (like [Joe Lizier](https://lizier.me/joseph/)), systems neuroscience (like [Mac Shine](https://macshine.github.io/)), consciousness (like [Nao Tsuchiya](https://users.monash.edu.au/~naotsugt/Tsuchiya_Labs_Homepage/HOME.html)), and quantum mechanics (like [Sahand Mahmoodian](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/sahand-mahmoodian.html)).
<!-- nanoscale information processing, like [Shelley Wickham](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/shelley-wickham.html), -->

**We are always looking for enthusiastic new students!**

**Our values**

- We aim to foster and encourage authenticity of expression and an environment in which all types of people, personalities, backgrounds, and beliefs, feel supported.
- We are committed to producing science that is high-quality, makes meaningful contributions, is open, and is clearly, transparently, and honestly communicated.
- We believe that high-quality and creative science is possible when group members have the freedom to follow their interests, and can protect time free for fun, nourishing, and complementary life interests and pursuits.
- We aim to train students in a way that helps them understand themselves and their motivations well and can align them with problems that excite and motivate them.
- Our obligation to students is to guide them to become independent thinkers, and to provide them with the skills and opportunities to do so.
- To ensure that we are continue to perform in accodance with these values, and can improve them, we regularly reflect on our values and practices and seek (anonymous) feedback on them from all team members.
