### Github

Our group's Github page is [here](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems).
You can find software packages for the tools we develop, and investigate code for reproducing results in our published papers.

### CompEngine

We have developed an interactive website, [_CompEngine_](http://www.comp-engine.org), that allows you to upload and explore connections between your time-series data and a library of thousands of diverse empirical and synthetic time series.

### Open software

We have also developed a range of software packages related to time-series analysis (with more on the way!):

- [_hctsa_ (Matlab)](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa), allows you to apply thousands of time-series analysis methods to a time-series dataset in Matlab.
- [_catch22_ (C, Matlab, python, R, Julia)](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22) allows you to evaluate 22 time-series features, coded efficiently in C and wrapped for python and with native versions for [R](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22) and [Julia](https://github.com/brendanjohnharris/Catch22.jl).
- [_pyspi_ (python)](https://github.com/olivercliff/pyspi) is a comprehensive library for computing pairwise interactions from multivariate time series.
- [_theft_ (R)](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft) implements the extraction, analysis, and visualisation of a range of open time-series features.

### Advice

We keep an active website containing general research advice across a range of topics [here](https://benfulcher.github.io/ResearchResources/).
