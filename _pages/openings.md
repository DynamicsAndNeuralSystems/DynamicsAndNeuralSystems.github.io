# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members!

The Neural Systems and Signals Group is dedicated to promoting a lab environment in which people with all types of personalities and backgrounds feel included and supported.

### Current open positions

A sample of graduate research projects currently on offer are [here](http://agile-prod.ucc.usyd.edu.au/research/opportunities/opportunities?search_by=Fulcher&commit=Search).
This is not a complete or restrictive list, but is mainly to act as a guide of the types of projects that you could work on if you joined our group.

Top-up funding is available for strong PhD students.

If you are interested in joining the group as a graduate research student, please send me an [email](mailto:ben.fulcher@sydney.edu.au).
Please attach a CV and include relevant undergraduate transcripts.
