# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members!
We are dedicated to growing an open and inclusive lab environment in which all types of personalities and backgrounds are appreciated and feel welcome.

### Current open positions

A sample of graduate research projects currently on offer are [here](http://agile-prod.ucc.usyd.edu.au/research/opportunities/opportunities?search_by=Fulcher&commit=Search).
This is not a complete or restrictive list, but is mainly to act as a guide of the types of projects that you could work on if you joined our group.

Some top-up funding is available for strong PhD students.

If you are interested in joining the group as a graduate research student, please send me an [email](mailto:ben.fulcher@sydney.edu.au). Please attach a CV and include relevant undergraduate transcripts.
