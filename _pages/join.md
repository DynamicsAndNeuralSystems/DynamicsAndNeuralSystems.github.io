# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members!

_The Dynamics and Neural Systems Group is dedicated to promoting a research environment in which people with all types of personalities and backgrounds feel included and supported._

If you're thinking about joining the group but are unsure of what the environment and culture is like, feel free to contact [some of the current or past members]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team) to get a candid assessment!

## Current graduate research projects

A sample of graduate research projects currently on offer are listed on the University of Sydney's [Research Supervisor Connect](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/research-supervisor-connect.html): a list of current projects are listed in [my profile](https://www.sydney.edu.au/s/search.html?f.Content+type%7Cx=research+opportunities&collection=Usyd&query=fulcher).
This is not a complete or restrictive list, but is mainly to act as a guide of the types of projects that you could work on if you joined our group.

<!-- Note that we currently have one [PhD stipend scholarship](https://www.sydney.edu.au/scholarships/d/nanoscale-brain-navigation-with-dna-computing.html) for domestic (Australian) students interested in the project [Algorithmic principles of navigating the brain using nanorobots](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/opportunities/2912.html). -->

__First, please read__: We have written some general advice about doing a PhD, including specific details about how to do a PhD at The University of Sydney are [here](https://benfulcher.github.io/ResearchResources/DoingAPhD/).

If you are interested in joining the group as a graduate research student, please send me an [email](mailto:ben.fulcher@sydney.edu.au).
Please attach a CV and include relevant undergraduate transcripts.
Top-up funding is available for strong PhD students.

## Undergraduate or visiting research students

Talented undergraduates at Sydney University can apply for a summer research scholarship [here](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/undergraduate/faculty/science.shtml#DPSS).

We also keep some basic resources about visiting or moving to Sydney [here](https://benfulcher.github.io/ResearchResources/SydneyTips/).
